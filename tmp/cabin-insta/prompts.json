    "prompt": "Cinematic horror movie poster for Instagram: A man with shaggy wavy brown hair and a full beard stands by a glowing wood stove in a dark cabin, wearing a cream-colored t-shirt and light gray sweatpants. Low angle shot looking up at him. The wood stove door is open, casting warm orange-red firelight that illuminates his face from below. Rustic wooden plank ceiling with a round ceiling light fixture. In the dark shadows to the right, a creepy bald mannequin-like figure lurks menacingly. Rocks/stones visible at the base of the stove. Atmospheric moody lighting, film grain. Title 'THE CABIN' in bold distressed red letters at bottom. Tagline: 'Some fires you can't put out.' 1980s horror VHS cover aesthetic",
